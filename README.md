# Credit_EDA_Loan_Application
## Problem Statement:
Analysing Patterns present in the data using EDA to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

There are Two types of risks associated with the bankâ€™s decision, When it receives a loan application:

1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

The Aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as

1. denying the loan,
2. reducing the amount of loan,
3. lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

To understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
